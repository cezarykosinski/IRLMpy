# Infinite Rogue-Like Map Generator (* aka. Torchman)

__Currently not usable.__

#### IN PROGRES/TODO:
* [x] [GROUP] Finishing drilling <!--with randomized width of corridor. -->
* [x] [CELL/MAP/PROPERTIES] Reimplementing cell value calculation to include itself in the process.
* [ ] [GROUP/MAP] Implementing map escape invariant.
* [x] [MAP] Reimplementing CA to take under consideration borders of neighbours

#### STAGE 1
##### Single map operations

- [x] Map initialization
- [x] Automat
- [x] Bordering and Grouping
- [ ] Groups connecting
- [ ] Map escape assurance
- [ ] Code cleaning, optimising, classes and variables renaming

#### Stage 2 
##### Multiple maps control
- [x] Initiating base map
- [x] Map accessing
- [ ] Code cleaning, optimising mem usage(seed storing), classes and variables renaming

#### Stage 3
##### Player control
(placing a player, controlling it and map interaction with him)

<!--
