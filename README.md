# Infinite Rogue-Like Map Generator

_Currently not usable._

#### IN PROGRES/TODO:
* [GROUP] Finishing drilling with randomized width of corridor.
* [CELL/MAP/PROPERTIES] Reimplementing cell value calculation to include itself in the process.
* [GROUP/MAP] Implementing map escape invariant.
* [MAP] Reimplementing CA to take under consideration borders of neighbours.

#### TO_REFACTOR:
- [ ] camelCase or snake_case
- [ ] append or +=
- [ ] constants as maps or classes
- [ ] logging(?)

#### STAGE 1
##### Single map operations

- [x] Map initialization
- [x] Automat
- [x] Bordering and Grouping
- [ ] Groups connecting
- [ ] Map escape assurance
- [ ] Code cleaning, optimising, classes and variables renaming

 Stage 2 
Multiple maps control
- [ ] Initiating base map
- [ ] Map accessing
- [ ] Code cleaning, optimising mem usage(seed storing), classes and variables renaming
